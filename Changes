	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.2  Wed Jul 15 10:46:00 1998
	- line-endings were in DOS-format. That's the result if you think
	  "oh, just hack this up on the dos prompt". Dang. Sorry.
	- corrected and tested the installation
	- streamlined the documentation

0.3  Mon Aug 31 09:51:00 1998
	- methods can be uppercase or lowercase (this was a problem with the
	  new LWP)
	- archivename now in standard format

0.4  Mon Sep 28 11:10:44 CEST 1998
	- better example in the Synopsis (this one actually works!)
	- bugfixes in the handling of GET (this didn't work before)

0.5  Thu Aug 19 14:02:13 MET DST 1999
	Several user-reported bug-fixes and some extensions:
	- fixed synopsis (missing ";")
	- handle reset buttons identically to submit buttons
	- debug now shows the expanded URL and not the given link
	- support for textarea fields
	- special support for radio buttons (they are now handled in the
	  same way as selections and only one value is submitted to the
	  server on press(...))
	- special support for checkboxes (only checkboxes with defined
	  value are submitted to the server, undefined ones are left
	  out)
	- support for image buttons
	- support for HTML 4.0 button tags (they are handled identically
	  to their input equivalents)
	- when the form-tag doesn't have a method attribute, GET is assumed
