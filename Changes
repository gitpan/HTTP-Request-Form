Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Request::Form.

0.1  Fri Feb 13 11:49:30 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.2  Wed Jul 15 10:46:00 1998
	- line-endings were in DOS-format. That's the result if you think
	  "oh, just hack this up on the dos prompt". Dang. Sorry.
	- corrected and tested the installation
	- streamlined the documentation

0.3  Mon Aug 31 09:51:00 1998
	- methods can be uppercase or lowercase (this was a problem with the
	  new LWP)
	- archivename now in standard format

0.4  Mon Sep 28 11:10:44 CEST 1998
	- better example in the Synopsis (this one actually works!)
	- bugfixes in the handling of GET (this didn't work before)

0.5  Thu Aug 19 14:02:13 MET DST 1999
	Several user-reported bug-fixes and some extensions:
	- fixed synopsis (missing ";")
	- handle reset buttons identically to submit buttons
	- debug now shows the expanded URL and not the given link
	- support for textarea fields
	- special support for radio buttons (they are now handled in the
	  same way as selections and only one value is submitted to the
	  server on press(...))
	- special support for checkboxes (only checkboxes with defined
	  value are submitted to the server, undefined ones are left
	  out)
	- support for image buttons
	- support for HTML 4.0 button tags (they are handled identically
	  to their input equivalents)
	- when the form-tag doesn't have a method attribute, GET is assumed

0.6  Thu Mar  2 19:23:54 CET 2000
	Some extensions that I needed myself:
	- added support for input field type "file"
	- added a fix to change all field-types to lowercase
	- added support for the referer header

0.7  Thu Mar  2 21:14:03 CET 2000
	Added some user-requested features
	- added a sample for yahoo that uses an anonymous press
	- changed the servername in the altavista example
	- added a diagnostic check when pressing a button, that the
	  button is really defined
	- added better support for checkboxes. See the is_checkbox and
	  the checkbox_* functions
	- added support for (x,y)-coordinates when pressing image buttons

0.8  Mon Dec 18 09:57:00 CET 2000
	Some bugfixes and some extensions:
	- textarea should now work in both forms. Before there was either
	  a problem with textareas that included some default text, or
	  with empty textareas. Now Form.pm does look wether the contents
	  of a textarea is able to perform as_HTML and only uses it if
	  it is able to do it. Should fix some longstanding problems with
	  textareas.
	- ex/yahoo.pl wasn't in the MANIFEST
	- added a simple test procedure that just checks if it can be loaded

0.9  Thu Feb 9 19:43:00 CET 2001
	Some bugfixes and some extensions by Sean M. Burke:
	- ISINDEX is supported
	- a new constructor new_many is created that parses all forms of
	  a HTML file so you don't have to manually extract links any more.
	  This constructor handles stray form elements outside of forms.
	- the name of form elements is cached and can be queried

0.95  Fri Feb 10 08:01:00 CET 2001
	Some bugfixes from Sean M. Burke:
	- textarea was still broken in new_many, now fixed.
	- iteration over self->content || [], not self->content alone
	  (that one could be undef)

0.951 Thu Sep 13 10:19:00 CET 2001
	One small bugfix by Michael Kablitz
	- textarea-handling was broken and needed double $ because of
	  references. Damn typos. Funny thing: nobody else mentioned it.
	  Half a year with a broken package :-)
